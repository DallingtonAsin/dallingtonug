            <h5 class="title">Introduction</h5>
            <p>
            I am a professional software engineer and computer science instructor with four years of experience. I am the founder of <a href="https://agrixinnovations.com" class="text-info" target="_blank">AgriX</a>, a platform that empowers farmers in remote areas of Uganda to access markets for their agricultural produce, purchase inputs, and gain access to vital farming information and weather insights. I founded <a href="https://pivosoft.com" class="text-info" target="_blank">Pivosoft</a>, a startup digitizing small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Additionally, I established <a href="https://x.com/codingacad" class="text-info" target="_blank">Pivosoft Coding Academy</a>, offering free mentorship to young people in software development.
            I graduated with First Class Honors as the top student in my cohort with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. Previously, I volunteered as a visiting lecturer at Makerere University with the support of my former professors. Currently, I am a lecturer at the International Business, Science, and Technology University.
        </p>

            <p>
                My commitment is to harness technology to tackle societal challenges. Notably, I have built software applications for small, medium-sized businesses in Kampala, such as Kimote Maize Factory, Kakongoriro Stores, and Collection Hub, and non-governmental organisations notably <a href="https://www.experienceeducate.org" class="text-info">Educate!</a>. Additionally, I have collaborated with Vastel Health, a private health company, and designed Vastel, a mobile application that enables patients seek medical services through virtual consultations with medical professionals.

                        <p>
                            From a young age, I aspired to become a resourceful scientist, inspired by the achievements of prominent figures such as Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Neils Bohr, and Galileo Galilei.
                            As an engineer, this inspiration continues to motivate me to create innovative and impactful solutions for society.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My engineering journey took shape in 2016 when several organizations adopted my <a class="text-dark" href="https://posv1.pivosoft.com" target="_blank">first software system</a> for use in their business operations. This success increased my confidence in my problem solving abilities and my capacity to provide solutions to the community.
                            Subsequently, I was motivated to create more <a href="#projects" class="text-info">software projects</a>, which have since been acquired by factories, hotels, and supermarkets, and others.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Soon after completing my internship at Bank of Uganda, I conceived the idea of developing
                            software systems in teams. This concept has since materialized as <a href="https://pivosoft.com/" class="text-info" target="_blank">Pivosoft</a>, a
                            software company that develops software and trains young Ugandans in computer programming.

            <p>
                Dallington graduated with <span class="text-info">honors</span> and as the best student in Bachelor of
                Science in Software Engineering in May 2021 from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda.
                The Government of Uganda funded his undergraduate education after he emerged as one of the country's top
                students in the national high school examinations in 2016.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prior to enrolling in the university, Dallington completed his Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE)
                at St. John's S.S. Nyabwina, where he was also granted a scholarship. He majored in PCM/ICT (Physics,
                Chemistry, Mathematics, and Computer Studies) and obtained <span class="text-info">18</span> out of
                <span class="text-info">20</span> possible points, with an A in Mathematics, Bs in Physics and
                Chemistry, and 2 points for the auxiliary disciplines (General paper and computer studies).
                <br><i class="text-info">Achievement</i>:<i> Emerged as the best student in the school, the entire district, and ranked among the top students in the country.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                From 2010 to 2013, Dallington attended Bugarama High School for Ordinary Level Education on a full
                scholarship, where he earned <span class="text-info">14</span> aggregates out of <span class="text-info">8</span> and was the top student in terms of overall school O-level achievement.
                <br><i class="text-info">Achievement</i>:<i> Emerged as the best student in the school, the second best in the entire district, and among the top students in the country.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                At Rweibaare Primary School, where he spent eight years, Dallington Asingwire began his academic career.
                He received an overall score of <span class="text-info">7</span> out of <span class="text-info">4</span>, with a D1 in mathematics and D2s in science, English, and social
                studies. He was the best student and received a Primary Leaving Examination (PLE) Certificate.
                <br><i class="text-info">Achievement</i>:<i> Emerged as the best student in the school and among the best students in the country.</i>
