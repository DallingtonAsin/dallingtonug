            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                I am a professional software engineer and computer science instructor. 
                <!-- and the founder of <a href="https://pivosoft.com" class="text-info" target="_blank">Pivosoft</a> and
                <a href="https://x.com/codingacad?t=OAkfNiUtQr9rbwkmecXVWg&s=08" class="text-info" target="_blank">Pivosoft Coding Academy</a>. -->
                
                
                 I graduated with First Class Honors as the top student in Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. Previously, I volunteered as a visiting lecturer at Makerere University through the support of my former professors. Currently, I am a lecturer at the International Business, Science, and Technology University, where I teach students from diverse social and cultural backgrounds.
            </p>

            <p>
            <!-- Leveraging full-stack expertise and extensive experience, I design and build dependable and scalable software systems.  -->
            My commitment is to harness technology to tackle societal challenges. Notably, I have built software applications for small and medium-sized businesses in Kampala, such as Kimote Maize Factory, Kakongoriro Stores, and Collection Hub. Additionally, I have collaborated with Vastel Health, a private health company, and designed Vastel, a mobile application that enables patients seek medical services through virtual consultations with medical professionals.

            <!-- <h5>Academic Interest</h5>
            <p>

            <p>
                <i>
                    Many women in Uganda and Africa in general die or lose their unborn babies while giving birth.
                    This is usually attributed to a lack of prompt medical attention. I conducted research and developed a mobile application, vastel that
                    enables patients like pregnant women, among others seek medical services with medical professionals through virtual consultations.
                    I strongly believe that there is still a huge gap that needs to be filled in our health sector, which motivates me to pursue a master's degree,
                    conduct research, and bridge this gap by developing more advanced solutions for our health sector and other sectors in Uganda and Africa as a whole.
                </i>

            </p>
            <i>My primary research interests include computational science (biocomputation), artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction. I am ravenously hungry for new knowledge and skills in the specified areas of research so that I can apply them to achieve my ultimate goal. My ultimate goal is to become a distinguished computer science professor and researcher who will revolutionize health care, education, and e-government systems in Uganda and around the world.</i>

                            From a young age, I aspired to become a resourceful scientist, inspired by the achievements of prominent figures such as Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Neils Bohr, and Galileo Galilei.
                            As an engineer, this inspiration continues to motivate me to create innovative and impactful solutions for society.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My engineering journey took shape in 2016 when several organizations adopted my <a class="text-dark" href="https://posv1.pivosoft.com" target="_blank">first software system</a> for use in their business operations. This success increased my confidence in my problem solving abilities and my capacity to provide solutions to the community.
                            Subsequently, I was motivated to create more <a href="#projects" class="text-info">software projects</a>, which have since been acquired by factories, hotels, and supermarkets, and others.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Soon after completing my internship at Bank of Uganda, I conceived the idea of developing
                            software systems in teams. This concept has since materialized as <a href="https://pivosoft.com/" class="text-info" target="_blank">Pivosoft</a>, a
                            software company that develops software and trains young Ugandans in computer programming.

            <p>
                From 2010 to 2013, Dallington attended Bugarama High School for Ordinary Level Education on a full
                scholarship, where he earned <span class="text-info">14</span> aggregates out of <span class="text-info">8</span> and was the top student in terms of overall school O-level achievement.

            <p>
                At Rweibaare Primary School, where he spent eight years, Dallington Asingwire began his academic career.
                He received an overall score of <span class="text-info">7</span> out of <span class="text-info">4</span>, with a D1 in mathematics and D2s in science, English, and social
                studies. He was the best student and received a Primary Leaving Examination (PLE) Certificate.
