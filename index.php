            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                I am a professional software engineer with more than three years of experience.
                Graduated as the best student in the class of 2021 with First Class Honors (<span class="text-info">4.53
                    <span class="text-dark">out of</span> 5</span>) in
                Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda.
                I've demonstrated the ability to build dependable and scalable software systems by leveraging full-stack expertise and experience. I'm a passionate lecturer at ISBAT University,
                where I teach students from a variety of social and cultural backgrounds.

            <h5>Academic Interest</h5>
            <p>
                Academically, my main areas of interest include advanced software engineering, applied cryptography, and computer security.
                As a result, I intend to pursue these courses in order to get as much knowledge and understanding as possible, as well as to create software systems that will aid in the resolution of global challenges such as climate change.

                        Dallington Asingwire is a Ugandan male born on November 16, 1996, in Ryenjoki, Kyangyenyi Sheema District, Western Uganda. Sentara Dallington, his father, and Ninsiima Annet, his mother, bore him.
                    </p>
                    <span>
                        <p>
                            From his boyhood, Dallington aspired to be a resourceful scientist, drawing inspiration from the achievements of various world-renowned scientists such as Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Neils Bohr, and Galileo Galilei.
                            Even now, he believes his ambition is still alive because he works in engineering, a field that he grew up in as a dream.
                            His zeal for influencing the community through the creation and implementation of breakthrough technology motivates him.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Dallington's first sale of one of his software systems was <span class="text-primary">$492</span>, which greatly increased his confidence in visualizing the magic of empowering and impressing the mind with the correct input.
                            Dallington was inspired by <span class="text-info">Mark Zuckerburg's</span> graduation speech at <a href="http://www.havard.com">Havard University</a> in 2017 to understand the need for every human life to have a sense of purpose rather than progress, and as a result, he has that level of desire, willingness,
                            and enthusiasm to have a positive impact on many human lives in this world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Dallington intends to establish a technology firm that will help many young Ugandans gain skills and knowledge that they will use to create ideas that would make the world a better place.
                            He, too, aspires to be one of the great computer science professors, and he feels that by doing so, he would encourage many Ugandans to realize and have a sense of purpose.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            Time is one of the most valuable assets that humans can always put to good use, and
                            Dallington enjoys putting his time to good use.
