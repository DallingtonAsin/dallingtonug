            <hr />
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                I am a professional software engineer and computer science instructor with four years of experience.
                Graduated as the best student with First Class Honors (<span class="text-info">4.53
                    <span class="text-dark">out of</span> 5</span>) in
                Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. Previously
                volunteered as a teaching assistant at Makerere University
                through former professors. I'm a lecturer at the International Business, Science, and Technology
                University, where I teach students from various social and cultural backgrounds.
                Technically, I have designed and built dependable and scalable software systems by leveraging full-stack
                expertise and experience. Passionate about using technology to solve everyday problems and I've done so
                by designing and developing software applications, most notably e-docta whih enables patients to seek
                remote diagnosis and treatment.

            <h5>Academic Interest</h5>
            <p>

            <p>
                <i>
                    Many women in Uganda and Africa in general die or lose their unborn babies while giving birth.
                    This is usually attributed to a lack of prompt medical attention to address complications. I conducted research and developed a mobile application (<a class="text-info" href="/projects/health/apks/e-docta.apk">e-docta</a>) that 
                    enables pregnant women to schedule medical appointments with medical professionals and access remote medical services.
                    But I still believe there is a huge gap that needs to be filled in our health sector, which motivates me to pursue a master's degree,
                    conduct research, and bridge this gap by developing more advanced solutions for our health sector and other sectors in Uganda and Africa as a whole.
                </i>

            </p>


            <i>My primary research interests include computational science (biocomputation), artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction. I am ravenously hungry for new knowledge and skills in the specified areas of research so that I can apply them to achieve my ultimate goal. My ultimate goal is to become a distinguished computer science professor and researcher who will revolutionize health care, education, and e-government systems in Uganda and around the world.</i>

                    <p>
                        Dallington Asingwire was born in Ryenjoki Village, Kyangyenyi Subcounty, Sheema District, Western Uganda.
                    </p>
                    <span>
                        <p>
                        I aspired to become a resourceful scientist at a young age, drawing inspiration from the achievements of prominent scientists such as Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Neils Bohr, and Galileo Galilei. 
                        Being in the field of engineering, which was my childhood ambition, motivates me to be as resourceful and innovative as possible. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 2016, several organizations adopted Dallington's <a class="text-dark" href="https://posv1.parkproug.com" target="_blank">first software system</a> for use in their business operations, which boosted his confidence in problem solving and delivering solutions to community issues.
                            I was subsequently motivated to create more <a href="#projects" class="text-info">software projects</a>, which have since been acquired by hospitals, hotels, and supermarkets, among others.
                            Mark Zuckerberg's 2017 commencement address at Harvard University inspired Dallington to comprehend the need for every human life to have a sense of purpose rather than progress, and as a result, he has the desire, willingness, and zeal to have a positive impact on many human lives in this world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Soon after completing my internship at Bank of Uganda, I came up with an idea of developing
                            software systems in teams, a concept that has evolved into Code Solutions & <a href="https://pivosoftltd.com/" class="text-info" target="_blank">PivoSoft Ltd</a>, a
                            software hub that has trained a significant number of young Ugandans in computer
                            programming.

                            Time is one of the most valuable assets that humans can always use effectively, and Dallington enjoys using his time effectively.

            <h5>Education</h5>

            <p>
                Dallington graduated with <span class="text-info">honors</span> and as the best student in Bachelor of
                Science in Software Engineering in May 2021 from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda.
                The Government of Uganda funded his undergraduate education after he emerged as one of the country's top
                students in the national high school examinations in 2016.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prior to enrolling in the university, Dallington completed his Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE)
                at St. John's S.S. Nyabwina, where he was also granted a scholarship. He majored in PCM/ICT (Physics,
                Chemistry, Mathematics, and Computer Studies) and obtained <span class="text-info">18</span> out of
                <span class="text-info">20</span> possible points, with an A in Mathematics, Bs in Physics and
                Chemistry, and 2 points for the auxiliary disciplines (General paper and computer studies).
                <br><i class="text-info">Achievement</i>:<i> Emerged as the best student in the school, the entire district, and among the top
                    students in the country.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                From 2010 to 2013, Dallington attended Bugarama High School for Ordinary Level Education on a full
                scholarship, where he earned <span class="text-info">14</span> aggregates out of <span class="text-info">8</span> and was the top student in terms of overall school O-level achievement.
                <br><i class="text-info">Achievement</i>:<i> Emerged as the best student in the school, second best in the entire district, and among the top
                    students in the country.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                At Rweibaare Primary School, where he spent eight years, Dallington Asingwire began his academic career.
                He received an overall score of <span class="text-info">7</span> out of <span class="text-info">4</span>, with a D1 in mathematics and D2s in science, English, and social
                studies. He was the best student and received a Primary Leaving Examination (PLE) Certificate.
